# React Application with JWT Authentication

### Overview

This is an example application that serves an ExpressJS JSON api to a React client application. The React application is configured for a basic JWT authentication flow **WITHOUT** using redux. Great for those of you that are somewhat familiar with Node, Express, and Mongoose, but want to see an implementation of React + React Router with JWT authentication.
